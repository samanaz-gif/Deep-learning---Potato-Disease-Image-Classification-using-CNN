# Deep-learning---Potato-Disease-Image-Classification-using-CNN


This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of potato diseases into three categories: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight. 
The dataset undergoes preprocessing including cleaning and scaling before being split into training, validation, and test sets.
The CNN model is built using Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers, achieving impressive results with a loss of 0.0357 and an accuracy of 98.67% on the training data, and a validation loss of 0.0461 and validation accuracy of 97.40%.
